I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering of University of Texas at Austin, where I mainly work on medical/surgical/soft robotics. 

***My research interests include:***

Medical/Surgical Robotics: Development of high dexterity continuum manipulators, soft robots, and instruments for minimally invasive treatment of various medical /surgical applications.

Modeling of Soft Robots: Study of mathematical modeling approaches and algorithms that can solve the unknown correlation between actuation inputs, and outputs of internal distributed forces, tendon-tension transmission loss and deformation behavior of continuum manipulators.

Control Algorithms and Medical Imaging: Development of intelligent control algorithms and medical imaging systems for human-in-the-loop control to further improve quality of the surgery and patient safety.
